# How to run the program
If you do not have opencv, please install by using pip install opencv-python command. Otherwise, you can not run the program.
## Part 1
1. Use python3 HW3-1.py to run the program.
2. 1-image with deviation vectors, Matching 1-book1 and 1-image with RANSAC, Matching 1-book1 and 1-image, Matching 1-book2 and 1-image with RANSAC, Matching 1-book2 and 1-image, Matching 1-book3 and 1-image with RANSAC and Matching 1-book3 and 1-image will be in output folder.
## Part 2
1. Use Visual Studio Code (VS code) program to run HW3-2.ipynb.
2. 2-image after K-means (K = 5, 7, 9), 2-image after K-means with K-means++ (K = 5, 7, 9), 2-image pixel distribution before mean-shift, 2-image pixel distribution after mean-shift (bandwidth = 30), 2-image after mean-shift with color information (bandwidth = 30), bandwidth vs number of converged means (color information), 2-image after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 10), 2-image after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 30), 2-image after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 50) and bandwidth vs number of converged means (color and spatial information) will be in image folder. 2-masterpiece after K-means (K = 5, 7, 9), 2-masterpiece after K-means with K-means++ (K = 5, 7, 9), 2-masterpiece pixel distribution before mean-shift, 2-masterpiece pixel distribution after mean-shift (bandwidth = 30), 2-masterpiece after mean-shift with color information (bandwidth = 30), bandwidth vs number of converged means (color information), 2-masterpiece after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 10), 2-masterpiece after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 30), 2-masterpiece after mean-shift with color and spatial information (bandwidth = 50) and bandwidth vs number of converged means (color and spatial information) will be in output folder.
